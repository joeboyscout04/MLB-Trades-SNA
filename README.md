# MLB-Trades-SNA

This is a project for the Coursera course "Social Network Analysis" taught by Lada Adamic from University of Michigan.  

This objective of this project is to analyze the 'sociability' of Major League Baseball teams through an analysis of their trading patterns.  I hypothesized that baseball teams should exhibit some social patterns based on their payroll, number of wins, geography, or division. 
The data collection and processing was performed in R and the social network analysis utilized [Gephi](http://gephi.github.io/).
